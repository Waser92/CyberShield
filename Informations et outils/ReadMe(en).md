WELCOME TO CYBERSHIELD!


Cybershield is a secure password manager, entirely coded in python language. 
Our application lets you save your logins and passwords in total security. 
All your information is encrypted (thanks to the "bcrypt" library), which means that only you can access it. 
If a hacker tries to access your information, he'll only find worthless random characters.

if you don't have python, install it from the microsoft store (it's free)
